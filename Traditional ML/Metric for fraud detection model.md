You're in a Machine Learning interview at Google. The VP hands you a fraud detection model with a 0.98 ROC AUC and asks:

"Is this model ready to ship?"

90% of candidates walk right into the trap.

The textbook answer is to look at the score and celebrate. They said:
"0.98 is phenomenal. The curve hugs the top-left corner perfectly. The separation between classes is distinct. Let's deploy."

𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲: They aren't optimizing for a balanced dataset; they are optimizing for a massive imbalance (e.g., 1 fraud per 100,000 transactions).

The ROC Curve is chemically addicted to 𝐓𝐫𝐮𝐞 𝐍𝐞𝐠𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐬.

Because the 𝐅𝐚𝐥𝐬𝐞 𝐏𝐨𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐑𝐚𝐭𝐞 (𝐅𝐏𝐑) uses the total number of negatives (legitimate transactions) in the denominator, a massive pool of legitimate traffic dilutes your errors.

You can have a model that misses 50% of fraud cases, but because you have 10 million legitimate transactions, the ROC line still looks perfect. It is lying to you.

𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐒𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:
To pass the interview, you need to identify 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐌𝐚𝐣𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐌𝐢𝐫𝐚𝐠𝐞.

You must switch metrics immediately to the 𝘗𝘳𝘦𝘤𝘪𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯-𝘙𝘦𝘤𝘢𝘭𝘭 (𝘗𝘙) 𝘊𝘶𝘳𝘷𝘦.
- ROC includes True Negatives (the massive majority).
- PR Curve ignores True Negatives entirely.

It focuses exclusively on the minority class performance. When you switch the plot, that "perfect" 0.98 ROC often collapses into a jagged, embarrassing 0.12 PR AUC, revealing that your model is mostly hallucinating or missing the actual crime.

"ROC scores are optimistic proxies in high-imbalance domains. For fraud or rare disease detection, I ignore 𝘙𝘖𝘊 and optimize for 𝘈𝘳𝘦𝘢 𝘜𝘯𝘥𝘦𝘳 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘗𝘳𝘦𝘤𝘪𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯-𝘙𝘦𝘤𝘢𝘭𝘭 𝘊𝘶𝘳𝘷𝘦 (𝘈𝘜𝘗𝘙𝘊) to ensure we aren't hiding poor recall behind a wall of easy negatives."

Also, can use the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) for an imbalanced dataset
