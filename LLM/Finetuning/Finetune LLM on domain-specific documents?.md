You're in an AI/ML Engineer interview at OpenAI.

Interviewer: "We want to fine-tune a large language model on domain-specific documents. How would you approach it while avoiding catastrophic forgetting?"

You: "Fine-tuning requires a balance between learning the new domain and retaining general capabilities. I’d start with data preparation and sampling strategies."

Interviewer: "Go on. What steps would you follow?"

You: "Stepwise:

1. Dataset curation: Ensure the domain-specific corpus is clean, representative, and diverse. Include counterexamples to avoid overfitting.

2. Adaptive fine-tuning: Use techniques like LoRA or adapters rather than full-parameter tuning. Keeps base capabilities intact while learning new patterns efficiently.

3. Regularization strategies: Implement dropout, weight decay, and embedding regularization to prevent catastrophic forgetting.

4. Validation and evaluation: Track domain-specific metrics (accuracy, F1, ROUGE) alongside general LLM capabilities to ensure balance.

5. Iterative checkpoints: Save intermediate models and evaluate incremental improvements to detect drift or forgetting early.

Interviewer: "How do you handle tokenization issues in a new domain?"

You: "I’d analyze the token distribution. If domain-specific terms are frequently split, consider adding them to the tokenizer vocabulary. This reduces out-of-vocabulary embeddings and improves model performance.

Interviewer: "Deployment concerns?"

You: "
  - I'd monitor latency and memory footprint.
  - Use model distillation or quantization if needed. 
  - Maintain fallback to base model in production for queries outside the domain.
  - Observability and versioning are critical for safe rollout."

Interviewer: :)
