You're in a Senior MLE interview at Google DeepMind. The interviewer sets a trap:

"Our new foundation model is overfitting severely on the training set. Should we cut the hidden dimension size from 4096 to 1024 to limit its capacity?"

90% of candidates walk right into it.

The candidates say: "Yes. Overfitting means the model has too much capacity, it's memorizing noise instead of learning patterns. We should reduce the number of parameters (neurons/layers) to force generalization."

It feels logical as a textbook answer. It's also the wrong architectural move.

The reality is that they aren't optimizing for parameter efficiency, they are optimizing for the loss landscape.

When you starve a network by reducing its size, you aren't just preventing overfitting, you are creating a harder optimization problem. Smaller networks have complex, non-convex loss landscapes filled with nasty local minima. They struggle to converge at all.

𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐒𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: The Senior Engineer knows the real rule of thumb: 𝘕𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳 𝘶𝘴𝘦 𝘮𝘰𝘥𝘦𝘭 𝘴𝘪𝘻𝘦 𝘢𝘴 𝘢 𝘳𝘦𝘨𝘶𝘭𝘢𝘳𝘪𝘻𝘦𝘳.

Instead, you lean into 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐎𝐯𝐞𝐫-𝐏𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐏𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐝𝐨𝐱.

You keep the massive architecture (or even make it bigger). You want the high capacity to ensure the model has the power to learn complex boundaries easily. Then, you aggressively constrain the weights using actual regularizers.
- Keep the 4096 hidden units.
- Crank up the regularization (𝘓𝘢𝘮𝘣𝘥𝘢/𝘞𝘦𝘪𝘨𝘩𝘵 𝘋𝘦𝘤𝘢𝘺) or 𝘋𝘳𝘰𝘱𝘰𝘶𝘵.

We trade the risk of "underfitting due to small size" for the manageable challenge of "tuning λ."

𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐀𝐧𝐬𝐰𝐞𝐫 𝐓𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐆𝐞𝐭𝐬 𝐘𝐨𝐮 𝐇𝐢𝐫𝐞𝐝:

"I wouldn't touch the architecture size. It's easier to regularize a large model than to train a small one. I’d keep the capacity high to ensure learnability, then increase the regularization term λ to penalize the weights until generalization improves."
